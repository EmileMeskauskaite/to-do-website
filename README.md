This project is a comprehensive To-Do List web application built with Vite and React.js, featuring a RESTful API. It provides a robust set of features including user registration, authentication, and the ability to create, view, and delete to-do tasks.

The application is developed using Vite, a next-generation front-end build tool, and React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This combination allows for a fast development, build process, and a highly interactive user experience.

Security is a key focus, with token-based authentication implemented for task deletion, ensuring that only authorized users can remove tasks.

The application leverages SQLite3 for data persistence, providing a lightweight yet powerful solution for data storage. This makes the application easy to deploy and scale, while ensuring data integrity and efficiency.

The combination of these features and technologies makes this To-Do List application a versatile tool for managing tasks in a secure and user-friendly environment
